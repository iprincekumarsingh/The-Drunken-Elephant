          <p class="commondosName">The Monkey General - Samrat Reddy</p>
          <p class="commondoContent">
            He comes from a long line of commandos who kicks up new and
            innovative ideas from nothing. Being an engineer, he travelled to
            the land of the Kangaroos and then decided it was time to get into
            the business. He then decided that he needed to take the next step
            so he travelled over the seas to the land of Scotch Whiskey to
            complete his business degree. The monkey was there jumping around
            on a mission to identify able Commandos for expediting the Project
            X. This is where The Monkey finally found his General. The Monkey
            sent him out to jump around the Jungle and understand the dynamics
            of the wild. This is where the Monkey and the General found a huge
            gap in the market for smoothies and fresh juices. After a year and
            a half of R&amp;D, planning and refining, the “Drunken Monkey” was
            born. The Monkey wanted to bring back the days of yore, where the
            monkeys would interact with each other over a nice healthy
            smoothie rather than message or chat using the small idiot box
            which we carry around. With an aim to be the best, the monkey
            ordered the General to have the vision to be the Big Kahuna of
            smoothies in the entire jungle. This monkey General is key to
            conquering new lands and taming thick and dangerous forests. So if
            the monkey needs to enter your lands, better get to know the
            general.

            The Monkey needed a Commander in Chief, a leader who could lead
            and inspire the monkey tribe. This is where Kamal comes in. He is
            known for building high-performance teams that can work with the
            same passion that he brings to the jungle. The Monkey Chief brings
            his expertise in retail best practices and processes, engaging
            insights on revenue generation, expansion, consumer behavior,
            excellent relationship building ability, and effective strategic

            Smoothie Empire across the world!
